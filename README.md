# LDA and RF in *R*
Assignment realized for the course *Multivariate Analysis* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya*. 
 
 Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),  Classification trees and Random Forests in *R*:
 

 - LDA performed on the `phoneme.csv` dataset. We implemented also some of the LDA extensions, like QDA, FDA, RDA, MDA.
 - Random Forests and Classification Trees implemented on top of the `Ionosphere` dataset, already available in the *R* packages.

Both methods are implemented according to the following steps:
 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), through which we explore and prepare the dataset
 2. Application and interpretation of the LDA/RF methods

The project is entirely realized using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.

For each method we built a `Rmd` file: `LDA.Rmd`, `CART_RF.Rmd`. We include in this repository also the *.html* files generated from the above mentioned notebooks, one for each  method. The notebooks (and the corresponding generated *.html* files) contain a full description of the steps performed in the application of the methods.

Further details about the followed steps and the obtained final results are described in the [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/MVA-Assignement3/blob/master/Assignment_3_MVA.pdf) file.
